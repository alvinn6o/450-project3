#CECS 450 Project 3 - Option A - ILS Approach Visualization#

[Quick Demo Video](https://youtu.be/TXTqFz7CSM8)

##About the Dataset#
- Two datasets (Collapsed and Expanded)
  - Contains pilot eye-movement pattern sequences 
- Collected during an Instrument Landing System Approach
- Sequences capture pilot gaze shifts across Areas of Interest (AOIs), with each AOI representing a flight instrument and displayed as a letter (A-H).
Spreadsheets showed:
Rows representing a Pattern Sequence
Rows had frequency values
How many times the pattern occurs in the dataset
Rows had “Sequence Support” (shows proportion)
Percentage of how many pilots used the pattern during flight
The data is separated into two groups with each having sheets with and without the A AOI:
Successful
Unsuccessful pilots
